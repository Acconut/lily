#[
show is a neat function that will dump any kind of a value, even classes!
You don't need to do anything to a class to get it to work with show.

class Point(x: integer, y: integer)
{
    var @x = x
    var @y = y
}

define f {}

show(1)
show("2")
show([3, 4, 5])
show([6 => 7, 7 => 8])
show(Point::new(9, 10))
show(print)
show(f)
