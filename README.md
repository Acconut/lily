## Lily

Lily is a programming language focused on expressiveness and type safety.

## Sample

```
scoped enum Color { Black, Blue, Cyan, Green, Magenta, Red, White, Yellow }

# Class properties and methods are public by default.
class Terminal(var @foreground: Color, width_str: String)
{
    var @width = width_str.parse_i().unwrap_or(80)

    define set_fg(new_color: Color) {
        @foreground = new_color
    }
}

var terms = [Terminal(Color.White, "A"), Terminal(Color.Red, "40")]

terms.each(|e| e.width += 20 )
     |> print
```

## Features

#### Templating

By default, Lily runs in **standalone** mode where all content is code to
execute. But Lily can also be run in **template** mode. In **template** mode,
code is between `<?lily ... ?>` tags. When a file is imported, it's always
loaded in **standalone** mode, so that it doesn't accidentally send headers.
Files that are imported are also namespaced (no 'global namespace').

#### Embeddable

Lily may be a statically-typed language, but the reference implementation is an
interpreter. The interpreter as well as its API have been carefully designed
with sandboxing in mind. As a result, it's possible to have multiple
interpreters exist alongside each other.

#### Shorter edit cycle

Another benefit from having the reference implementation as an interpreter is a
shorter turn around time. The interpreter's parser is comparable in speed to
that of languages using an interpreter as their reference.

## Community
